                <div class="tab-target tab-target-background" style="display: none;">
                    <p>The philosophy behind Supercoach comes from IF Brommapojkarna's (BP) academy, who has managed to
                        establish themselves as one of Europe’s largest talent factories despite limited resources.
                        During the last years they have fostered international players such as Albin Ekdal, John
                        Guidetti and Ludwig Augustinsson, to name a few.</p>
                    <p>The most important step in the development of the academy was the transition from recruiting
                        players to educating players. The key to success was a clear and thought-out system with
                        increased difficulty levels for different ages. Over time the BP academy progressed into an
                        education, with a curriculum and trained leaders. Ola Larsson, the founder of Supercoach, was a
                        big part of this development. With a passion for developing both players and coaches and his
                        love for football, he's driven by a very simple but clear mission: to help more people become
                        better at football.</p>
                    <p>The learnings from his years in the academy was digitalised and the result was Digital
                        Fotbollsakademin (DFA), a company with the purpose of developing Swedish football. The product
                        was embraced by many of Sweden’s largest football clubs as Djurgårdens IF, Hammarby and
                        Assyriska. As new digital talent was added to company, it was time to take DFA to the next
                        level, and Supercoach was born.</p>
